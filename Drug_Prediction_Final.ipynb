Did get some sleep hopeing to feel better this morning,took another one and felt so spaced out dry mouth shaking ,sick, so booked in to see gp again to make sure i should be feeling like this, only to find out she had put me on the wrong dose should have been on 37.5mg was put on 150mg, now on right dose hope this will be better\"',\n",
       " '\"Hey Guys,  It&#039;s been 4 months since my last post as I wanted to give it a few months to see how this was going to work.  So, I have been on Trulicity for six months now with Metformin.  When I hit the five month period the diarrhea, gas, sulphur belching finally subsided.  I now longer have any of those side effects.

But After beginning my fourth week on it, I have been disappointed first by not feeling it has been helping my mood or depression at all, second by it seeming to be making my OCD (compulsive cleaning worse) and third by some really bad side effects when I jumped from 20mg (week 3) to 40mg (week 4) dose.  Side effects were really bad nausea and explosive diarrhea.  Diarrhea so bad I had 2 accidents in my pants and nausea worse than what I went through during chemotherapy after having had cancer a few years ago- thank goodness I kept an old anti-nausea medicine in my medicine cabinet. \"',\n",

       " '\"I created this account just to tell my experience with this medicine. I literally had almost given up on life.  My depression and anxiety were on a downward spiral and it was destroying my quality of life, relationships and school.  I have tried almost every kind of medicine possible to include Effexor XR, Adderall, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Paxil and Prozac alone.  Within a week, I have never felt better in my life, I&#039;m a new person.  My head feels clear, calm and optimistic.  I take it before bed, which knocks me out.  I love it because my racing mind kept me up all the time.  At first its hard to wake up, but now I wake up alert and chipper, before I literally would sleep for two days straight.  This has changed my life so much.  \"',\n",

I insisted it was the medication and was told it wasn&#039;t because it worked great for my blood pressure.  Had 2 near death experiences from &quot;asthma attacks&quot;. They stopped the Diovan and hydrochlorothiazide and I haven&#039;t had any problems with breathing.  I can be very active without losing my breath now.

I did have a little bit of a hard time falling asleep, I was taking 200mg Zoloft for about 2 yrs and it just pooped out. I haven&#039;t had any side effects yet. I&#039;m very hopeful of this antidepressant. Although I did have one side effect my  muscles feel like I ran a country mile.

       " '\"This medication makes me feel very weak no matter what time of the day I take it. I would not recommend it for anxiety seeing as you have to take it every day in order for it to lower blood pressure and make stressful situations more bearable instead of taking it as needed.\"',\n",
       " '\"At first I liked it. My Endocrinologist was waiting for it to be approved and available, so put me on it once it was. It lowered my Blood Sugar and my Blood Pressure. I did not lose weight as some do (which I suspect is mostly water weight from urinating more).  I had to stop my blood pressure medicine because I felt I was bottoming out with both meds (Invokana was lowering my blood pressure too). \\r\\n\\r\\nBut now that I have been taking Invokana, since it was available, I just recently stopped it due to not being able to handle the side effects anymore. I feel so FATIQUED ALL the time. My muscles ache once I get to the top of my stairs. I am out of breath and feel like I have run a marathon. My chest would feel tight and just felt faint all the time when doing anything! Add life&#039;s stresses (job) to that, and it made me so miserable!!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, I have been working out 4 days a week since Jan!! It is so frustrating. I am also on week 4 of a nothing but veggie and some fruit smoothies (no meat, wheat, and only dairy is whole fat Greek yogurt). So I figured since I was having to watch my blood sugars more closely, since they were lower with this new eating plan, now was a good time to quit the Invokana. I am hoping within a week I might feel like my old self again. Due to doing EVERYTHING I can to HELP my Diabetes, and I still felt bad, I knew it had to be my Invokana. The only other med I take is Lantis SolarStar. \\r\\n\\r\\nI started to get worried about long term effects of Invokana, especially since I was doing what anyone with health issues should do (exercise and eat super healthy), and still felt fatigued, I decided to do more research online and have found MANY others with my SAME and worse side effects. Many complain of constant yeast infections (both women and men), hair loss, swelling of lymph nodes to where they did STD tests and cancer screening, shortness of breath, fatigue, urinary tract infections, bladder infections, kidney issues (some really bad). I got scared reading so many many bad reviews. I don&#039;t want to end up with major kidney problems!!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I am going to do what every Type II Diabetic should do, and actually EAT HEALTHY and EXERCISE!! We are switching to organic foods and plan to continue drinking these green smoothies for 2 meals a day and have a reasonable dinner. We need to lose weight anyways. That will ensure we get tons of veggies and fruits and so much nutrition that we would otherwise be deficient in. We keep track of all our calories to ensure we get enough protein, and healthy fat etc. I also take some supplements, super foods, and vitamins made with whole food. We are going to stop all soda, sugar, artificial sweeteners, and pre-made and highly processed foods, as best we can...it will be a process, lol. . I am so mad at all that is put in our food, I can&#039;t believe it is legal!!. Most chronic type diseases are due to inflammation in the body and what we PUT in our bodies. Healthy in, healthy out. Crap in, crap out. You ARE what you eat. Stop putting chemicals and toxins in your body. Stop eating food that is not raised/cultivated naturally healthy. Eat whole food and &quot;clean&quot; foods. Cure yourself with Nature&#039;s Nutrition! Good luck to you all! :D\"',\n",
       " '\"3rd week, and I&#039;m only on 15 mg. I am very sensitive to medication. For instance, Zoloft completely zonked me and all I did was sleep. I started taking Viibryd at night, but didn&#039;t sleep for 3 nights. I switched to mornings and have had no trouble sleeping at night. I take it with a meal and have not had nausea, etc. I did have a terrible headache last night and believe the pain in my calves may be a side effect. My muscles in my calves feel like I&#039;ve run a marathon...very sore and tight. Also, I&#039;ve been unable to &quot;stop thinking&quot; and relax.

The nausea softened and Imodium AD took care of the Diarrhea.  Suddenly, I felt so much better and my libido came roaring back.  I haven&#039;t felt this good in many many years.

My psychiatrist even tried antipsychotics and mood meds all had really bad side effects including massive weight gain. He put me on mirtazapine and I slept really well no side effects whatsoever. It does cause increased appetite but I take 2 phenergan 50mg with it which is an OTC antihistamine and that stops the increased appetite cause the main side effect of phenergan is decreased appetite. I&#039;m from UK and I know you can&#039;t get it in the US. But I&#039;m sure u can buy it online. Hope this review helps\"',\n",

I almost fainted last Sunday, and again doctors couldn&#039;t see what the problem was, though maybe it could be side effects of the amlodipine.

After about 12 years of trying SSRI&#039;s and not having a lot of success we tried this drug.  It has been the best medication for my depression.  There are a number of precautions that you must remember to take.  #1  Challenge each doctor to check and see if a new medication will react badly to the Emsam, a lot of the medications have interaction with Emsam.  Also you must give up aged things, like Pepperoni, Salomi, Beer, Wine, and Worchester and Soy sauces.  I learned the hard way about the last 2.  Most important thing is challenge all new medications and MAKE the doctor look them up.  \"',\n",

       " '\"I got prescribed Anafranil after not impressive effects of tritico and zoloft, and yeah, it worked for a few months, but I had to up my dosage every now and then. However after around 4 months of taking it, it stopped working, I capped the dosage, and had to switch therapists, as the former had no idea what to do with severe depression. However what I&#039;d like to share is the withdrawal part. In the time I was off it, it was really bad, imagine being constantly drunk. You can not focus, your view is shifting, everything seems to be floating, also like a lagging game, it feels as the visual part comes later than the audio. Really weird, so if you are on it or planning to try, ask your doctor for a way to take it out gradually.\"',\n",
       " '\"My Doctor gave me 2 weeks of Abilify, 2mg as a sample to take in addition to my 450mg of Wellbutrin. Made me extremely dizzy and had difficulty driving safely due to this. \"',\n",
       " '\"On and Off depression and severe anxiety for 40 years.  Tried many medications, most with very uncomfortable side-effects.  Changed to Celexa over 8 years ago with remarkable results and absolutely no discernible side-effects.  Doctor had changed medicine to something new about 3 years ago and my wife made me go back to Celexa after only a few months.  Under extreme stress anxiety does return, but not nearly as severe.   I am now 62 years old.\"',\n",
       " '\"This medication is better than any of the other SSRI I&#039;ve tried so far. It has given me very few side effects that slowly diminished. Paxil is better, it does give you a calming effect that helps me relax, and I don&#039;t feel empty. \"',\n",
       " '\"It is a good medicine. It brought my blood pressure down to where it should be.  However, I did experience weight gain.  This is evidence by the change of my medication to a different blood pressure medicine and losing 10 pounds in less than 3 weeks.  I have not changed my diet in anyway since switching.\"',\n",
       " '\"Works very well. No noticable side effects.\"',\n",
       " '\"I suffer from anxiety, depression and panic attacks. 9/10 because its working for me but it&#039;s only the second anti-depressant I&#039;ve used. I was prescribed Cymbalta but had terribble nausea, body tremors, hot flashes and panic attacks.  With Pristiq I had nausea for three days but it was bearable and I was really restless. I had so much energy I walked around the block 3 times a day or more in the first week. It did stir up my depression and I had suicidal thoughts which is quite controversial because I never want to die and know in myself I would never do that to my girlfriend and my family I had insomnia the on the second night after starting my Pristiq but have had no insomnia ever since. All my side effects were gone after a week and then I was given a prescription for it. Life changing stuff.\"',\n",
       " '\"These postings are amazing for me. I was diagnosed with depression at 17 (59 now) and over the years have taken everything fro Prozac to Paxil to Welbutrin, and many others. Four years ago I was diagnosed with severe rheumatoid arthritis, and just a few months ago I was prescribed Tramadol for pain, while it did help somewhat with pain I suddenly noticed my depression was lifting for the first time in over 30 years. The difference is amazing and life changing. In addition I can go several days to a week with out it and I feel no withdrawal symptoms. I used to cry all the time, constant thoughts of suicide and I&#039;d stay in bed for days at a time. Now I exercise daily, ride my bike frequently (which also helps with the depression)\"',\n",
       " '\"Immediate results in lowering my blood pressure and holding steady after 2 weeks. Having feeling of light-headedness but doesn&#039;t last very long. Seems to be a great drug...so far so good.\"',\n",
       " '\"Female, age 55. Chronic dysthymia with episodes of major depression. Have been on Viibryd for about 4 weeks, ramping up from 10 to 40 mg, as I ramped off Zoloft. I also take Wellbutrin, Ativan, and Ritalin (for fatigue).  I have been a Type I diabetic for over 35 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had side effects when I began taking Viibryd.  Nausea (no vomiting), more frequent stools, fatigue and severe cognitive fuzz-out and difficulty with short-term memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyone else have chills with this med?  About 30 minutes after dosing, I typically get very shivery.  The affect does not last long and is not severe, but it is very weird!\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. told me to try taking 1/2 dose of Viibryd at bedtime or with evening meal, but this did not work because it made me wide awake.\"',\n",
       " '\"Works good, nothing negative to say.\"',\n",
       " '\"Been on this for about a week. So far the pros are: I am much calmer. I have a very stressful job that used to have me yelling and wanting to pull my hair out. Now I&#039;m calmly discussing issues with a reasonable mind. Also I noticed I have more energy and much more positive outlook on life. I&#039;ve even lost a few pounds because my appetite is somewhat suppressed. The cons are: very vivid dreams. Just about every night I have a very lucid and lengthy dream about something in my life. Another con is the first few days I felt a little &quot;out of it&quot; as others have said, but that stopped after about 3-4 days. The last con is that it&#039;s expensive. I have two insurances and still had a copayment. But I like it so much, it&#039;s worth the price.\"',\n",
       " '\"It feels slightly more effective than Prozac. I was slightly nauseous for about 24 hours after my first dose. In my opinion, the only downside to Trintellix is the price.\"',\n",
